üß≠ SaaS Project Guideline ‚Äî R Firm
This project is owned by R Firm, which will always prioritize maintainability and scalability across all SaaS solutions.
We follow professional development standards and value organization, clarity, and reusability in every component.
Rodrigo (DevOps Developer, 1.5 years of experience) designed this architecture to enable high-velocity iteration with long-term consistency.
üß± Backend Guideline ‚Äî FastAPI Core
Philosophy:
Each backend service should be independent, clear, and modular. We avoid deep nesting and unclear dependencies.
Architecture Layers:
Controller Layer (controllers/)
Defines API endpoints and routing logic.
Each domain or feature gets its own controller (e.g. user_controller.py).
Use clear URL prefixes and consistent naming conventions.
Service Layer (services/)
Contains the business/application logic.
No direct DB calls ‚Äî only uses repositories.
Reusable functions for specific operations (auth, email, analytics, etc.).
Repository Layer (repositories/)
Handles database access (CRUD operations).
Keep models paginated and typed using Pydantic.
Avoid ORM logic leaking into other layers.
Models (models/)
Pydantic schemas for requests and responses.
Typed models for each route ‚Äî do not use Any or untyped payloads.
Paginated responses for data retrieval.
Auth (auth/)
JWT-based authentication by default.
Must include token creation, validation, and refresh logic.
DB (db/)
Centralized database connection logic.
Only one declarative Base and engine definition ‚Äî avoid duplication.
Config (core/)
Centralized environment-based configuration (e.g. .env handling).
All constants and secrets loaded from this layer.
Utils & Middleware (utils/, middleware/)
General utilities (token hashing, logging, validation).
Middleware for request tracing, logging, and security headers.
Principles:
Each layer should have a single responsibility.
Avoid circular imports and unnecessary abstractions.
Keep endpoints RESTful, and where possible, make CRUD operations simple and consistent.
Offload heavy computation to the frontend or worker jobs to reduce server cost.
Always include a /health endpoint and versioning prefix /api/v1.

üì¶ PyPI Packages ‚Äî FastAPI Core Ecosystem

Package Usage Rules:

‚úÖ DO:
- Import and use these packages when building new features
- Check if functionality exists in a package before implementing it yourself
- Example imports:
  from rodrigo0000_fastapi_core_auth import AuthService, JWTHandler
  from rodrigo0000_fastapi_core_database import get_db, Base
  from rodrigo0000_fastapi_core_models import User, UserCreate
  from rodrigo0000_fastapi_core_services import EmailService, StripeService

‚ùå DON'T:
- Create new packages with these names (they already exist on PyPI)
- Duplicate functionality that exists in these packages
- Publish new versions without coordinating with the package maintainer
